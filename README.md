# Data Cleaning, EDA and ML

Imagine you're out in the forest, and you come across a beautiful mushroom. You might wonder, "Is it safe to eat?" 

In this project. I am using data science to help answer that question. The goal is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical features, such as color, shape, and texture.
My approach includes carefully exploring the data (EDA), cleaning it up to make sure the predictions are as accurate as possible, and finally building a model that can help identify which mushrooms are safe to eat and which should be avoided.
